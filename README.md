## Requirements

```
streamlit>=1.32.0
fastf1>=3.1.0
pandas>=2.2.0
numpy>=1.26.0
plotly>=5.20.0
scipy>=1.12.0
```

## Technical Details

### Data Source
- **FastF1**: Official F1 telemetry data API
- Coverage: 2018 season onwards
- Data includes: GPS coordinates, speed, throttle, brake, gear, sector times

### Calculations
- **Longitudinal Acceleration**: Calculated from speed differentials (m/s¬≤)
- **Lateral Acceleration**: Derived from GPS coordinates and speed using curvature analysis
- **Distance**: Computed from GPS X/Y coordinates when not directly available
- **Smoothing**: Savitzky-Golay filter applied to reduce GPS noise

### Performance
- Session data is cached using `@st.cache_data` for faster reloads
- FastF1 cache stores downloaded data locally to minimise API calls
- Telemetry data is preprocessed once and reused for multiple visualisations

## Key Features Explained

### Track Map Colouring
The comparison track map uses colour coding to show which driver was faster at each section:
- **Red**: Driver 1 faster
- **Blue**: Driver 2 faster
- **Gray outline**: Reference track layout

### Delta Time Chart
Shows cumulative time difference throughout the lap:
- **Above zero**: Second driver is slower
- **Below zero**: Second driver is faster
- Final annotation shows the total lap time gap

### Driving Patterns
Quantifies driving style with three key metrics:
- **Cornering %**: Time spent below 200 km/h
- **Heavy Braking %**: Brake pressure above 50%
- **Full Throttle %**: Throttle at 98% or higher

## Troubleshooting

### Session Won't Load
- Check internet connection (FastF1 requires API access)
- Verify the selected year/GP combination exists
- Try clicking "RELOAD" to refresh the session

### Missing Telemetry Data
- Some sessions may have incomplete telemetry
- Try selecting a different driver or a recent season
- Pre-2018 data is not available

### Performance Issues
- Clear the `f1_cache` folder to reset cached data
- Restart the application
- Close other browser tabs using the same port

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Race lap analysis support
- [ ] Practice session comparison
- [ ] Historical driver comparison across seasons
- [ ] Export analysis to PDF
- [ ] Custom track sector definitions
- [ ] Weather data integration
- [ ] Tire compound analysis
